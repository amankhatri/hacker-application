Please answer the following administrative/personal questions:

1. What is your desired compensation range?
   (Range meaning the least you're comfortable with
    to the most you think you're worth.)
  As a starter and a fresher I would ask somewhere between 50k-60K and a fun place to work in. 


2. When can you start?
   I can start as soon as I graduate. Anticipated Graduation date is May 2013.

3. Do you have any planned vacations/absences in the next
   six months that we should know about?
   No, I don't have any planned vacations or absences in next six months, provided we survive 21 December 2012 ,the predicted "Apocalypse" due to end of Mayan Calender. 

4. Do you have any problem with dogs?
   No, I don't have any sort of problems with dogs. I have a pet already (please refer to the bunny picture in the ascii file). Hey can we have nerf guns while at work?

5. Please describe one of the greatest costumes you've ever attempted,
   Halloween or otherwise.

8. If you learned the zombie apocalypse was going to erupt tomorrow, what
   would you do today?
   After doing extensive reserch on zombie apocalypse, me and my classmates have been consistantly testing our survival skills. if z-apocalypse happen today then I won't get a job at sparksfun and I won't be able to design my bumbleebee. What I would do is tame the walkers just as Michonne in walking dead does. :)
